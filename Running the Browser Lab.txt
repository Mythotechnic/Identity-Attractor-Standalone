Running the Browser Lab

Open:

web/identity-attractor-lab.html


…directly in a modern browser (no build step needed).

The HTML lab:

Lets you configure model, temperature, top-p, cycles, and seeds

Runs the OIS loop entirely in the browser via the OpenAI API

Plots D(t), ICI, and ∥Ĵ∥ per seed using Chart.js

Shows ASH fingerprints and a simple phase-lock evaluation against the same thresholds

For serious experiments, use the Python CLI version (reproducible runs, proper logging) and treat the HTML lab as an interactive visual console.
